## Starting off

### Importing files

```{r}
# Load in files

ufoData <- read.csv("Data/ufo_sightings.csv")

metData <- read.csv("Data/Meteorite_Landings.csv")

head(ufoData)
head(metData)
```

### Data wrangling

After reviewing the available information in these data sets, we decided to make
our target DataFrame the following:
`Year, Lat, Long, Type`

* `Year` = the year of the meteorite or UFO sighting
* `Lat` = the latitude of the event
* `Long` = the longitude of the event
* `Type` = the type of the event (Meteorite or UFO sighting)

We will be analyzing whether there is a correlation between the location of the event and the year in which they happened.
